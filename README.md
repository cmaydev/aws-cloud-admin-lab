# aws-cloud-admin-lab

Hands-on AWS cloud administration lab with networking, security, monitoring, and incident recovery



\# AWS Cloud Admin Lab



\## Purpose of This Lab

This lab demonstrates foundational cloud administration skills using AWS, including networking design, security controls, compute provisioning, monitoring, and incident-style troubleshooting.



The goal is to simulate the responsibilities of a junior cloud administrator or cloud operations role.
